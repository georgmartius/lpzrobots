\dir selforg

The selforg directory contains the controller and a small framework to use them in different scenarios.
The class \ref Agent is a subsumption
of a robot, a controller and a wiring. 
The wiring specifies the connections between the sensor values of the robot
and the sensor values of the controller, and between the motor outputs of the controller 
and the motor values given to the robot. 
It also faciliates logging and plotting of parameters.

The following subdirectories are included:
 - \ref selforg/matrixlib : comfortable matrix library used for calculations e.g. in our controllers
 - \ref selforg/controller : contains controller with some necessary helper modules
 - \ref selforg/wiring : implementation of standart wirings, that connect robot and controller
 - \ref selforg/utils : utility code
 - \ref selforg/examples : examples for the usage of controller, the framework and the matrix library.
