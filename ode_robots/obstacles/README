\dir obstacles

Obstacles in our simulations are different kinds of boundaries, so called arenas or playgrounds.
\ref Playground is just a rectancular arena, \ref ClosedPlayground one with a ceiling.
The \ref OctaPlayground can have 8 corners but even more, because the number of corners is
adjustable, so you can even generate a circular arena.
Furthermore there is a class \ref TerrainGround for using ppm files as ground in simulations.

The \ref Sphere is at the moment the only moveable (e.g. through collisions with moving vehicles) 
obstacle but all other bodies are also possible.
