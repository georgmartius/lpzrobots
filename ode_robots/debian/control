Description: 3D physically realistic robot simulator
 A simulation framework to simulate robotic experiments in C++. The physics
 is implemented using the Open Dynamics Engine (www.opende.org) and
 the graphical rending is done with OpenSceneGraph. It has some 
 distrinct features like a physical material support, nice camera handling,
 online configuration and display of parameters.
 Many robots, sensors, motors and examples are included.  
 Experiment are expected to be programmed and compiled.
