/**
\dir simulations

The simulations directory contains the different simulations originated from our work
on the selforganization issue.

For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_onerobot.
Just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.
