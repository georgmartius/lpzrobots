\dir ode_robots/robots 

The robots of our simuated worlds "live" in this directory.
You find the class \ref AbstractRobot here, which provides the interface fulfilled
by all the robots (which are derived from this class).
\ref Nimm4 you maybe already know from the simulation 
\ref ode_robots/simulations/template_onerobot "template_onerobot".\n
Both (the \ref ode_robots/simulations/template_onerobot/main.cpp "main.cpp"
 of the template_onerobot simulation and nimm4.cpp) are really good 
commented and therfore recommended as first example. You can easy find them by clicking 
on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page .
