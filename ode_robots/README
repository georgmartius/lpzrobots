\dir ode_robots


The ode_robots directory provides all the stuff necessary for
 simulations with the physics engine ODE (http://ode.org).

\par Simulation Environment

The class \ref lpzrobots::OdeConfig "OdeConfig" holds the configurable parameters of the simulation environment
like \ref lpzrobots::OdeConfig::gravity "gravity", 
\ref lpzrobots::OdeConfig::simStepSize "simStepSize", 
\ref lpzrobots::OdeConfig::realTimeFactor "realTimeFactor" and so on.\n
In the class \ref lpzrobots::Simulation "Simulation" you find the functions 
 to overload like 
\ref lpzrobots::Simulation::start "start" and \ref lpzrobots::Simulation::end "end" 
 which have to be overloaded by all simulations.
Additionally you can overload functions like  
\ref lpzrobots::Simulation::command "command" to react on keystrokes, 
\ref lpzrobots::Simulation::config "config" for configuration purposes (rarely required) and some more.

\par Simulation objects and more

The things inside the simulation environment (and some additional stuff) is inside 
the following subdirectories
- \ref ode_robots_simulations "simulations":
	ready to use simulations
- \ref ode_robots/agents "agents":
 	structure to build a "complete" agent (consisting of a controller, 
	a robot and the wiring in between), different wirings
- \ref ode_robots/robots "robots":
	our robots,creatures, vehicles or whatever you would like to call 
	them are in this directory
- \ref ode_robots/osg "osg primitives":
	many classes for the osg and ode integration. 
	It provides Primitives and Joints of which robots and obstacles can be assembled, 
          and further helpful things to deal with OSG
- \ref ode_robots/motors "motors":
	a few additional motors (PID servos)
- \ref ode_robots/sensors "sensors":
	up to now an infrared-sensor and a sensor-bank is available
- \ref ode_robots/obstacles "obstacles":
	passive obstacles like different kinds of playgrounds, a sphere and usage of terrains
- \ref ode_robots/utils "utils":
	all the little things that make life easier
- \ref ode_robots/ode_patches "ode_patches": OBSOLETE! 
	our patches for ODE 0.5 and drawstuff
- \ref ode_robots/textures "textures":
	our textures used in the simulations and a program for calculating heigt-maps

\par How to start your own simulation

To start a new project it is recommended to copy one of the existing simulations from <tt>ode_robots/simulations/</tt> e.g. one of the "template" folders.
To easy the procedure use
the createNewSimulation.sh script in the simulations directory:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_dir newsimname </tt>\n
where \p template_dir is the template directory you wish to copy and \p newsimname is the
name of the new simulation you wish to create. This takes care of your installation type
 and other things like possible superficial CVS information.

Example:
\verbatim
cd ode_robots/simulations
./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot mysimulation
\endverbatim
For user-type installation you probably want to put the simulation in a separate directory, that means:
\verbatim
./createNewSimulation.sh template_onerobot ~/path/to/simulations/mysimulation
\endverbatim

Now you can adjust the simulation as you like.
A simple make in the simulation directory should be enough. 
In case your simulation code consists of other files than main.cpp, 
 please add them to FILES in the Makefile.conf in the simulation directory.
 You also have to run <tt>make depend</tt> afterwards!

If you insert a new file to the simulation framework, 
such as a new obstacle, robot or similar you DON'T need to add them anyvery. 
Every *.cpp file in the directories specified in Makefile.conf is
compiled and included in the library libode_robots.a. 
In case you add a new directory with source files, 
which should be included in the lib, then add it to Makefile.conf.
In any case run a <tt>make</tt> in the lpzrobots directory, 
 this creates the neccessary dependency information to ensure a proper build.

\par How to add a new robot or obstacle or controller to your simulation
- Locate a similar object in the simulator. You find this under: \p ode_robots/robots, \p ode_robots/obstacles, and \p selforg/controller
- copy the .h and .cpp file to you simulation folder, e. g. \p nimm4.cpp and \p  nimm4.h
- rename it to whatever you like, say <tt>myrobot.cpp</tt>, <tt>myrobot.h</tt>
- modify the code so that the class has the new name, e. g. \p MyRobot
- change include directives to have a <tt> \<ode_robots/ \></tt> style. 
\verbatim
#include <ode_robots/primitives.h>
\endverbatim
- add "myrobot" to the Makefile.conf FILES variable
- run <tt> make depend </tt>
- ready to use the stuff in your simulation (use #include "myrobot.h")

\par Collision control and Materials
\ref ode_robots_collisionhandling "Read more here"

/**
\page ode_robots_simulations ODE-Robots Simulations

The simulations directory (<tt>ode_robots/simulations</tt>) contains different simulations 
 mostly originated from our work on the self-organization of behavior.

You can just go into one directory, type \p make and after successful compilation \p start
to start a simulation. \n
For convenience you should start with one of the template directories like template_sphererobot.
Both the simulation file \ref ode_robots/examples/template_sphererobot/main.cpp "main.cpp"
 of the template_sphererobot simulation and robot definitions in  \ref sphererobot3masses.cpp are really good 
commented and therfore recommended as first example. You can easy find them by clicking 
on the tab  "Examples" at the top of the page.\n
For creating your own simulation just type:\n
<tt> $> ./createNewSimulation.sh template_sphererobot my_sim</tt>\n
to create the directory \p my_sim, adapt it to your needs, run \p make and \p start and it should work.

/**
\page ode_robots_collisionhandling ODE-Robots Collision handling
Since version 0.4 the collision handling was redesigned significantly. It has the following features:

 - Material properties for each object (\ref lpzrobots::Substance "Substance")
 - No user specific collision code necessary
 - Automatic ignorance of collisions between connected bodies
 - User defined ignorance pairs
 - fine grain callback functions on collisions possible (\ref lpzrobots::Substance "Substance")

\par How to set material properties
Modify \ref lpzrobots::Substance "Substance" in your local \ref lpzrobots::OdeHandle "OdeHandle", e.g.
\verbatim
odeHandle.substance.toRubber(20);
// create Primitive with odeHandle
Primitive* box = new Box(1,1,1);
box->init(odeHandle, ...);
\endverbatim
would change the substance to a soft rubber. Once you have created a Primitive you can change
 its properties in the same way:
\verbatim
box.substance.toMetal(0.6);
\endverbatim

\par How to disable collisions between two primitives
\verbatim
odeHandle.addIgnoredPair(p1,p2);
// and to remove
odeHandle.removeIgnoredPair(p1,p2);
\endverbatim
This mechanism is used internally for primitives that are connected by joints. 
So in most cases you don't have to worry about that.

\par How to disable collisions within an entire space
When you create the space with
\verbatim
  odeHandle.createNewSimpleSpace(parentspace,true/false);
\endverbatim
you can set the flag to true to ignore all internal collisions.
Alternatively you can change this for an existing space with:
\verbatim
odeHandle.addIgnoredSpace(spaceID);
// and to remove
odeHandle.removeIgnoredSpace(spaceID);
\endverbatim
