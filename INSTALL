lpzrobots installation hints. Please check also the online documentation
at http://robot.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/software

Install from source:
type
> make
this will first create a configuration file.
Anwser the following questions. 
1) The installation path is usually /usr/local but
 can also be /home/yourlogin for an installation without root permissions.

2) The installation type:
  u) User installation means to install the simulator library and header files 
  into the system, which are then supposed to be fixed
  d) If you plan to develop/change the simulator then you better go for this option.
  Only the utilities are installed on the system, but the libraries and header files
  are kept in the lpzrobots directory which is then you working directory with
  all the simulations and so on.

3) Are you sure? ;-) answer y want to proceed

Note that this choice will change all the makefiles of the simulations. 
The user makefiles expect a system installation, i.e. that the libraries and include
 files are found by the compiler/linker in the usual places, whereas the development
 makefiles expect that the folder structure within the lpzrobots directory is as it is.

You can change you configuration by calling 
> make conf 
again.
